Supercomputing tutorial 2 March 2020, Ashley Trudeau

Data club next Monday will focus on supercomputing (using Rutger's Amarel cluster) and will be led by Ashley Trudeau-- please take a look at the following information ASAP, as registration for OARC can take a couple days to go through. The necessary files are attached and will be uploaded to Github as well by Monday. As always, feel free to forward this to other students/postdocs you think might be interested!

From Ashley: This week in data club we're going to go through a basic introduction to the cluster computing resources available at Rutgers. These resources are extremely useful for parallel processing, running lots of analyses at once, and/or running long analyses. We're going to use the cluster called Amarel, which is available to everyone at Rutgers. Our goal will be to submit a job containing a simple R script. And then if there is time remaining, you can try packaging and submitting one of your own analyses. Before our meeting on Monday, there are a few things you need to do so that you can access and use Amarel. 

To do: 

-          Register to use Amarel here: https://oarc.rutgers.edu/access/

o   The form asks some questions about what you plan to install. You can say that you will install miniconda3 and R.


-          Download Notepad ++ or a similar text editor if you don’t have it already

o   https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v7.8.4/

o   Notepad++ is not available for Mac users, but Brackets is supposed to be a good alternative: http://brackets.io/

o   For Notepad++: convert windows-style to UNIX-style line endings:

§  Go to Edit menu, select “EOL Conversion” submenu, and then select “UNIX” option


-          Bring some of your own code for an analysis that you’d like to run. 

-          Look around the OARC cluster guide: https://rutgers-oarc.github.io/training/

o   There’s a lot here that we won’t get into. If you only look at one thing, read the General Information section under Cluster Guides. Much of the guide assumes you will run your jobs from the command line; we’re going to use the OnDemand GUI
